In regular Javascript a string can be converted to a number by prefixing it with a +, so `+someNum`

Need to install the Typescript compiler to run Typescript.
After it's installed, can run `tsc file.ts` to compile to JavaScript.

Typescript files end with `.ts`.

Adding `!` after a query can be used to tell TypeScript that the value will always be present.

`as SomeType` can be used to type cast a variable.

Parameter mismatches give a compilation error.
Imports have to be on JS files as browsers don't know anything about TS.

TypeScript adds types, interfaces, generics and next-gen JS features as well.
